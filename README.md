## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshwinKumar-V/404NotFound/main/.github/images/Screenshot.jpg)

Hey there devs, this was my first project at devChallenges.io to build a responsive website. It was realy interesting as i got to use flexbox for the first time. This really improved the CSS of this project compared to using float and positions. But I'm sure the CSS can be improved furthur once I learn more new features.
You can checkout my demo at https://ashwinkumar-v.github.io/404NotFound/.
