## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshwinKumar-V/404NotFound/main/.github/images/Screenshot.jpg)

Hey there devs! This was my first project at devChallenges.io to build a responsive website. This was really interesting as I got to use flexbox for the first time. This really improved the CSS of this project compared to using float and positions.
You can checkout my demo [here](https://ashwinkumar-v.github.io/404NotFound).
